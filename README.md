## Technical assessment

### Main aspects we will evaluate:
- How much the codebase is production-ready.
- Code structure, and organization of responsibility.
- Performance.
- Resilience to failures.

### The specification

Write an application that helps users to manage a simple list of tasks to get done. Users should be able to:   
- Add a new task to the list. Each task has a name and a boolean status "isDone".  
- Mark the task as "done"  
- Delete the task
